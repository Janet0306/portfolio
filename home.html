            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Janet Webster. I have recently graduated from
              The University of the West of Scotland with a First Class Honours
              degree in Mobile and Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017 I took the difficult decision to change my career. Until
              this point, I had held various roles in retail head offices.
              However, after a period of reflection, I felt that this career
              path was no longer fulfilling for me and therefore decided to
              change.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a background in both retail and business, I have developed
              several soft skills. I have experienced roles that have allowed me
              to lead a team, demonstrate effective communication, and work to
              deliver success.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a hard-working individual, with a strong passion to succeed.
              I thrive in situations where I am able to help and support others.
              I seek opportunities to develop my skills, in order to continue
              growing and improving. I am a friendly and approachable individual
              who enjoys forming relationships.
            </p>
            <p>

            An E-learning platform built using MERN. Students can add courses to

          <p class="project-description">
            For my 4th Year Honours project I decided to learn a completely new
            stack – the MERN stack. Prior to this point I didn&#39t have much
            experience in NoSQL databases, and although I had a good level of
            knowledge of JavaScript, I had not used the React framework.
          </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            Teach has a secure login/registration system. Once a user registers
            they are directed to a profile section of the site and encouraged to
            fill the section out, once this has been completed they will then be
            directed to their personalised dashboard. The dashboard is the
            section of the site where a user can view any topics that they have
            chosen to complete. The dashboard will also display the user&#39s name
            and allow then to edit their profile or delete their account. Each
            topic contains a quiz, factsheet and flashcards and there is a
            search feature so that users can easily locate a topic.
          </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            As well as being educational, the site also has a social component.
            The web app has a section that allows all users to search and see
            all students that are on the site. There is also a discussion board
            where users can post questions and fellow users can post replies.
            Users profiles also have a section for users to add there social
            media handles so that other users can connect.
